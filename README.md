# Air-Drawing
Final project for the MAIS 202 bootcamp. This app would allow users to "draw" basic shapes by waving their hand in front of a camera.

# How to Run it Yourself

Use the following command to install all the necessary libraries:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Next, simply download all the files in the Demo folder into the same directory and run the Demo.py file using the command "streamlit run Demo.py".
