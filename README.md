# air-drawing
Final project for the MAIS 202 bootcamp. This app would allow users to "draw" basic shapes by waving their hand in front of a camera.

To test it out yourself, simply download all the files in the Demo folder into the same directory and run the Demo.py file using the command "streamlit run Demo.py". (Make sure you have all the correct packages installed)
